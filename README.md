# Algorithmic_Maze_Solver

This Java program utilizes A* algorithm, an AI computer program that used in pathfinding and graphic traversal, to calculate the shortest path from the start tile of the maze to the end tile. Then, it prints out whether or not it found an end tile, the number of steps it took to get to the end tile, the number of tiles still in the priority queue, and the number of steps taken.

It uses a priority queue that keeps track of which tile to visit next.
